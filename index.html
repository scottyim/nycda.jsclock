<!-- ASSIGNMENT
Using the clock that we created...

1. Change the text color to red if it is an odd minute and to another color if it is an even minute.

2. Change the background color to a random color every 5 minutes. 
SWITCH BETWEEN 2 COLORS, RANDOM IS EXTRA CREDIT

3. Change the font size to a different value every hour, selected from an array of font sizes.
